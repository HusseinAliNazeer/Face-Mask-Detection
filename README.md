# Face Mask Detection

This repository contains the code and materials for a face mask detection system using computer vision and deep learning techniques.

## Description

The face mask detection system is designed to identify whether an individual is wearing a face mask or not. The system uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify images as either "with mask" or "without mask". The model is trained on a dataset of images of people wearing and not wearing face masks.


## Requirements

To run the face mask detection system, you will need to have the following libraries installed:

- OpenCV
- numpy
- tensorflow
- keras
